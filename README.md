## To init project you need
 Have mongoCompass or Robo 3T installed
### How to start the project
1. Open in terminal the base path of the project and run npm (This is for backend)
2. Open in terminal the client folder and run npm (This is for Frontend)
3. To run the app you need to run npm run dev command in the base path not in the client cd.
4. First in the app you need to register an user to use all the queries to DB and access to the views.

#### Some notes
1. All the frontend is connected to the backend and the DB automatically been created when you run the first query to this.
2. The file config in backend folder serves for create Dynamic credentials(PORT, DB_CONNECTION, URL, etc)
3. For better experience in the develop mode from the app, I recommend to you, use two terminals, one in the cd client(npm run client) and another with the cd base(npm run serever)

#### Thank you for your support! :)
